# Week 1 (Practice Simple Select Queries)
*left to [Rubricator](../README.md)*

To prepare for the graded coding quiz, you will be asked to execute a query, read the results, and select the correct answer you found in the results. This question is for you to practice executing queries. I have provided you the script for this query, a simple select statement. Think of this as a sandbox for you to practice. As you practice executing queries, take time to read the results in order to prepare for the quiz and get comfortable writing a basic select statement.

**1. Run query: Retrieve all the data from the tracks table. Who is the composer for track 18?**

SQL code:</br> 
```SQL
SELECT TrackId
,Composer 
FROM Tracks
WHERE trackid = 18;
```

Result:</br> 
| TrackId | Composer|

| 18 | AC/DC |

**2. Run Query: Retrieve all data from the artists table. Look at the list of artists, how many artists are you familiar with (there is no wrong answer here)?**

SQL code:</br> 
```SQL
Select *

Where Name IN ("AC/DC", "Led Zeppelin");
```

Result:</br>
